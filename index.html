        <p>This page demonstrates how to use AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to fetch data from a JSON file containing information about Star Wars movies. AJAX allows web pages to retrieve data from a server without reloading the entire page. The data is sorted using the Bubble Sort algorithm, which is chosen for its simplicity and ease of understanding. The JSON file includes movie posters from the <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com" target="_blank">OMDb API</a>.</p>
        <p>Even though the data is stored locally, using XMLHttpRequest or fetch to access it still qualifies as a full use of AJAX. The methods used here are the same as those for retrieving data from a remote server.</p>
        <p>To show a more typical use of AJAX with remote server requests, you could set up a server-side component to return data. However, for educational purposes, using a local JSON file is simpler and more convenient, so no server-side part was created.</p>
