        <p>This page demonstrates the use of AJAX to fetch data from a JSON file containing information about Star Wars movies. The data is then sorted using the Bubble Sort algorithm. For convenience, the JSON file was created with movie posters from <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com" target="_blank">OMDb API</a>. Using data from a JSON file with XMLHttpRequest or fetch is still considered a full-fledged use of AJAX, as AJAX by definition means asynchronous interaction with a server to fetch data without reloading the page. In this case, although the data is stored locally, we are using the same methods and approaches that are applied to fetch data from a remote server.

However, to demonstrate a more typical use of AJAX with requests to a remote server, one can create and use a server-side part that returns data. But for educational purposes and examples, a local JSON file is quite suitable. The server-side part was not created for the sake of convenience.</p>
