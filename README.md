# CinemaSorterJS

## Overview

CinemaSorterJS is a dynamic web application designed to demonstrate sorting algorithms with a fun twist—sorting new movie releases! This repository uses JavaScript, Ajax, DOM manipulation, and event handling to provide an interactive way to explore the bubble sort algorithm.

## Features

- **Bubble Sort Implementation**: Experience how the bubble sort algorithm organizes lists of movies.
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Utilize Ajax to load movie data asynchronously without reloading the web page.
- **Interactive UI**: Engage with the DOM to see the sorting process in action.
- **Event Handling**: Learn how JavaScript handles user inputs and other events to provide a responsive experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need a modern web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. No additional installations are required.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shliamin/cinemasorterjs.git
   cd cinemasorterjs
   ```
2. Open the index.html file in your browser to start using the application.

### Usage

**CinemaSorterJS** allows users to interactively sort movie lists using the bubble sort algorithm. Here’s how you can make the most out of this application:

1. **Viewing Movies**:
   - Navigate to the main page where the list of new movie releases is displayed.
   
2. **Sorting Movies**:
   - Click the 'Sort' button to initiate the sorting process. You can choose the sorting criterion from a dropdown menu (e.g., release date, title).
   
3. **Interactive Feedback**:
   - Watch as movies rearrange themselves in real time during the sorting process. This visual feedback helps users understand the efficiency and step-by-step operation of the bubble sort algorithm.

4. **AJAX Calls**:
   - AJAX is used to fetch movie data asynchronously, ensuring the page does not need to be reloaded when new data is retrieved or sorted.
